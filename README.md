# Introduction

This is a brief analysis of gene expression levels of tissues infected with Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma. The paperâ€™s main objectives are to compute the correlation coefficients between genes collected from healthy and infected tissues and report the set of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) before and after applying the false discovery rate (FDR) correction. All analysis was carried out in Python.
